INTERVIEW QUESTIONS :
====================

1.) What is Normalization?
Normalization in DBMS is the process of organizing or structuring a database to reduce the data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking the tables into smaller related tables and linking them using keys.


2.) Explain primary key vs foreign key?                                                                                         
Primary Key : A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence   Foreign Key : A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table.                   

3.) What are constraints?
Constraints are rules applied to columns in a table to enforce data accuracy and integrity.
Common constraints:   PRIMARY KEY , FOREIGN KEY , UNIQUE , NOT NULL , CHECK , DEFAULT


4.) What is Surrogate Key?
A column that is not generated from the data in the database is known as a surrogate key. Rather, the DBMS generates a unique identifier for you. In database tables, surrogate keys are frequently utilized as primary keys.



5.) How do you avoid data redundancy?
To avoid data redundancy, focus on efficient database design, implement normalization techniques, and establish clear data management practices.                                                                                                                       


6.) What is an ER Diagram?
ER (Entity-Relationship) Diagram is a visual representation of the database structure.
It shows:
Entities (e.g., Student, Course)
Attributes (e.g., name, roll number)
Relationships between entities (e.g., enrolls in)
It helps in designing the database before actual implementation.


7.) What are the Types of Relationships in DBMS?
There are three main types:
i.) One-to-One (1:1)
One entity is related to only one entity.
Example: One person → One passport.

ii.) One-to-Many (1:N)
One entity is related to many others.
Example: One teacher → Many students.

iii.) Many-to-Many (M:N)
Many entities are related to many others.
Example: Students ↔ Courses (a student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students).




8.)  Explain the Purpose of AUTO_INCREMENT?
AUTO_INCREMENT is used in MySQL to automatically generate a unique number for a column, usually the Primary Key.
Example : 
CREATE TABLE students (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
   name VARCHAR(100),
   PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
When a new row is inserted, the id will be automatically increased by 1.


9.)  What is the Default Storage Engine in MySQL?
The default storage engine in MySQL is:
i.) InnoDB 
It supports:
Transactions
Foreign keys
Row-level locking


10.) What is a Composite Key?
A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that together uniquely identify a row. Used when no single column is unique by itself.

Example : PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
Here, both student_id and course_id together make a unique record (used in many-to-many relationships).
